# A Comparison of Na√Øve Bayes and Random Forest on Mushroom Poisonous
== Instructions ==

One Jupyter Notebook and five Matlab code files used in this machine learning project.  
'mushroom_data_visualization_harrytamhoyin':
This is used for data cleaning and data visualization. 

'mushroom_naive_bayes_training_harrytamhoyin': 
This is used to generate and train the best Naive Bayes model.

'mushroom_naive_bayes_testing_harrytamhoyin': 
The test set is used on the best trained Naive Bayes model and the performance metrics are evaluated.

'mushroom_random_forest_hyperparameters_harrytamhoyin':
Training set is applied on fitcensemble method to find the hyperparameters.
The hyperparameter tuning takes more than 30 minutes. 

'mushroom_random_forest_training_harrytamhoyin': 
This is used to generate and train the best Random Forest model.

'mushroom_random_forest_testing_harrytamhoyin': 
The test set is used on the best trained random forest model and the performance metrics are evaluated.


== Important Note ==
Please run the training script first before running the testing script.
